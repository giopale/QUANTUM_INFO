This file includes two modules and a program:
	module FUNCTIONS
	module DEBUG
	program MATTEST1

*********	module FUNCTIONS	**************
This module contains all the functions used in the program.

	subroutine LOOPMULT(A,B,C)
		Arguments:
			A,B 		double precision,intent(in)
	        C 			double precision,intent(out),allocatable

		Performs multiplication of double precision matrices
		A,B and writes the result on C.
		Multiplication is performed by rows.

		Preallocation is needed only for A,B (input).

		The subroutine checks the match of size(A,2) and size(B,1)
		and stops the execution of the program if the check fails.

	subroutine LOOPMULTCOLUMNS(A,B,C)
		Arguments:
			A,B 		double precision,intent(in)
        	C 			double precision,intent(out),allocatable

		Performs multiplication of double precision matrices
		A,B and writes the result on C.
		Multiplication is performed by columns.

		Preallocation is needed only for A,B (input).

		The subroutine checks the match of size(A,2) and size(B,1)
		and stops the execution of the program if the check fails.

	subroutine INTRINSICMULT(A,B,C)
		Arguments:
			A,B 		double precision,intent(in)
        	C 			double precision,intent(out),allocatable

		Performs multiplication of double precision matrices
		A,B and writes the result on C.
		Multiplication is performed via intrinsic function MATMUL(A,B).

		Preallocation is needed only for A,B (input).

		The subroutine checks the match of size(A,2) and size(B,1)
		and stops the execution of the program if the check fails.


*********	program MATTEST1	**************
This program tests the computational performances of different matrix
multiplication algorithms, by measuring CPU_TIME().
The test is performed by multiplying two randomly generated square matrices
using 1:LOOPMULT, 2:LOOPMULTCOLUMNS and 3:INTRINSICMULT.
The program allows to either choose the matrix size in advance or perform an 
automatic test. Computation times are measured increasing the matrix size by
100 each step up to maximum size.

I/O interface:
The program is called on bash by 
	$ ./MatTest1.out [filename] [size]
where both [filename] and [size] are optional arguments. The filename must be
given without extension, since it is added automatically. [size] is the maximum
matrix size that will be tested.
If no arguments are provided:
	- filename will be asked
	- test will run up to default max_size (500)

The output is given on file on four columns:

	SIZE 	T1[s] 	T2[s] 	T3[s]
